## Marina Papapetrou

A creative individual looking for a role as a Full Stack Junior Developer, I am an enthusiastic team player that will ensure any project reaches completion to the highest of standard. As a former freelance business owner in video production, I am a self-starter that requires little motivation to push for the best results. I regularly delivered high quality products to my clients and constantly seek to level-up my skills through my own research.  With the tech industry ever-evolving, I see an unlimited potential that I, as a creatively-minded person, am eager to explore through software development. I look forward to bringing new ideas to the company I work for - ensuring we keep up with the latest trends in web app design and development.

## Skills

#### Motivated Learner

Having taught myself how to use video production equipment and post-production software to a professional standard, I have developed into a natural self-learner. As a freelancer, I understood that technology is always evolving, so took on this challenge by keeping up with the latest trends, techniques and equipment. I've carried this drive and willingless to constantly level-up my skills into this new path as a software developer, ensuring that my learning and knowledge continues beyond what Makers Academy has provided.

#### Project Management

This skill became particularly useful when setting, and successfully achieving, minimum viable product outlines and sprint deadlines within the Makers Academy course. As a project manager, I have overseen the completion of many media projects for a number of clients on a freelance and in-house basis. I contributed to the growth of the training facilities at T4 Bubble Tea and Magic Memories through strategic planning of training content. I've also led on multiple projects to develop the branding of Refsix and Gold Arts Ltd. Throughout these projects, I have acquired an abundance of experience in managing time and budget constraints alongside the high standards set by myself and my clients.

#### Leadership

While always managing to meet my own deadlines, I am also skilled in helping others meet theirs. In 2017, I worked as a media practitioner for NCS where I was required to organise and implement a 3 day workshop. During this workshop, I guided a large group of 15-17 years olds through the production of their own community media projects. While they all started with little to no media experience, everyone was able to present their projects to their peers by the end of the 3-day deadline.
