As a former freelance business owner in video production, I am a self-starter that requires little motivation to push for the best results.

## Skills

#### AV equipment

Having taught myself how to use video production equipment and post-production software, I am now able to work on video projects to a professional standard. While starting in the industry with only a foundation of knowledge, I continued to learn while I worked and always ensured that I was up-to-date with the latest trends, techniques and equipment. Working at an established cinema allowed me to work with AV equipment on a large scale, where even a minor technical mishap could negatively impact business. Equipment I worked with included:
- Sony, Panasonic, Fuji, Canon and Nikon cameras
- Adobe Creative Cloud (in particular Premiere Pro, AfterEffects and Audition) and Final Cut Pro
- Various audio capture equipment including recorders, microphones and audio mixers
- LED lighting

#### Project Management

As a project manager, I have overseen the completion of many media projects for a number of clients on a freelance and in-house basis. I contributed to the growth of the training facilities at T4 Bubble Tea and Magic Memories through strategic planning of training content. I've also led on multiple projects to develop the branding of Refsix and Gold Arts Ltd. Throughout these projects, I have acquired an abundance of experience in managing time and budget constraints alongside the high standards set by myself and my clients. Using minimum viable product outlines and sprint deadlines, I have developed a structured system to ensure goals are met to the satisfaction of all.

#### Leadership

While always managing to meet my own deadlines, I am also skilled in helping others meet theirs. In 2017, I worked as a media practitioner for NCS where I was required to organise and implement a 3 day workshop. During this workshop, I guided a large group of 15-17 years olds through the production of their own community media projects. While they all started with little to no media experience, everyone was able to present their projects to their peers by the end of the 3-day deadline.

## Hobbies

As a creative individual that has a variety of skills in the visual arts, I enjoy making videos both professionally _and_ for leisure - you can see some of my work via my instagram handle @marinapapap. 

Having taken an early interest in the sciences, pursuing it in my earlier school years, I have carried this interest with my into adulthood and enjoy reading popular science literature (my favourite writer being Jim Al-Khalili).
