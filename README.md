As a creative individual I bring ideas and, as a highly organised individual, I bring solutions. Looking for a role as a Junior Software Developer, I hope to ultilse my diverse experience to really make a difference. 

As a former freelance business owner in video production, I am a self-starter that requires little motivation to push for the best results. I regularly deliver high quality products to my clients and constantly seek to level-up my skills through my own research. I'm also an enthusiastic team player that will ensure any project reaches completion to the highest of standard.

With the tech industry ever-evolving, I see an unlimited potential that I, as a creatively-minded person, am eager to explore through software development. I look forward to bringing new ideas to the company I work for and ensuring we keep up with the latest trends in web app design and development.

## Skills

#### Motivated Learner

Having taught myself how to use video production equipment and post-production software to a professional standard, I have developed into a natural self-learner. As a freelancer, I understood that technology is always evolving, so took on this challenge by keeping up with the latest trends, techniques and equipment. I've carried this drive and willingless to constantly level-up my skills into this new path as a software developer, ensuring that my ability continues to evolve beyond the Makers Academy course.

#### Project Management

As a project manager, I have overseen the completion of many media projects for a number of clients on a freelance and in-house basis. I contributed to the growth of the training facilities at T4 Bubble Tea and Magic Memories and led on multiple projects to develop the branding of Refsix and Gold Arts Ltd. Throughout these projects, I have acquired an abundance of experience in managing time and budget constraints alongside the high standards set by myself and my clients. This experience became particularly applicable when setting, and successfully achieving, minimum viable product (MVP) outlines and sprint deadlines within the Makers Academy course. 

#### Leadership

In 2017, I worked as a media practitioner for NCS where I was required to organise and implement a 3 day workshop. During this workshop, I guided a large group of 15-17 years olds through the production of their own community media projects. This is one among a number of experiences that I have had the priveledge of sharing my own knowledge and passion for the betterment of a group project. Working as a team is an opportunity I always capitalise on; through a combination of being highly organised and a positive communicator, I am an ideal player to help drive a team forward.

- Having pursued the sciences in my earlier school years with Physics, Chemistry and Maths A-Levels, I have carried this interest with me into adulthood, my favourite popular science writer being Jim Al-Khalili.
- Roller-blading and indoor climbing take up my more active interests.
